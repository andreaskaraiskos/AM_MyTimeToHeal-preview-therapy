Therapy takes place in a private and confidential setting, where you can feel safe to explore problems and have time to think and reflect on what is impacting your life.</strong></p><p><strong>The relationship</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> between us of great importance and it is important that you feel comfortable and safe with me so that you can work towards recognising emotions, thoughts and behaviours that perhaps hold you back, and in time will hopefully make you think more positively and calmly and you will feel better about yourself.</span><br></p><p><strong> I will take time</strong> to really listen to what you bring to your sessions, and we may explore and try to understand the unconscious aspects of your behaviours, thoughts and feelings and by doing so, together we can identify what is contributing to emotions that you feel are perhaps hindering or upsetting you in some way.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>I have learned the importance</strong> of communicating and exploring understandings of thoughts, feelings and behaviour in a way that is clear and meaningful to each person as a unique individual. Some clients like to take to explore their issues from a here and now perspective. Others wish to focus upon making changes for their future and some want time to explore the meaning of what has happened to them in their past and find ways in which they can change and feel more at ease with themselves.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><strong> At times,</strong> therapy may feel very challenging and possibly even unbearable as we explore together the conflicts you are battling with internally. You will gain insight and profound awareness which in time will bring with it relief and knowledge to help you change patterns of behaviour, overcome what you feel may obstructions and in turn improve your quality of life. It may help you stop unhelpful repetitive patterns which you may be doing without even realising.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> For psychotherapy and counselling to work,</strong> it will need you to be open and honest, it will need commitment and it will need patience. If you can learn to accept yourself, understand yourself, then change can happen.  To begin that change, then contact me (hyperlink to contact page) to book an appointment and see how therapy may help you.</p><p><br></p></div>

Sometimes we are very aware of the problem we are facing and other times it is less obvious. Whether you are coming for counselling or psychotherapy, you will be treated with respect, you will not be judged, you will be understood and helped to resolve your problems. Although to follow are some distinctions between the two, ultimately, whether you have counselling or psychotherapy, there is a great deal of similarity between the two and the outcome will result in a better understanding and acceptance of one’s self, and hopefully a better, healthier and more mindful way of being.</p><p><strong>Counselling is said to</strong> focus on working with what is very much in your awareness and works with the problem that is in the present. It is often sought at times when a person is feeling vulnerable or is having specific difficulties and it helps to clarify and explore what is happening to you whilst working towards a better well-being. It helps you deal with your emotional or psychological problems in an effective way.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>If you feel</strong> you are able to cope in most situations, that your problem may be temporary or that certain changes in your life are happening or need to happen, then counselling may be what you need.  People tend to come for counselling when they are encountering problems perhaps at home or at work, or a current relationship problem. It may help you manage life issues such as bereavement, domestic violence, serious illness, abuse, a recent trauma and relationship issues.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><strong> Psychotherapy&nbsp;works</strong> with in greater depth with perhaps more deep-rooted concerns that may lie within our pre-conscious and unconscious thoughts and may be problems that have developed over a longer period of time, often finding links with events or experiences that have occurred in your past. Psychotherapy will explore childhood experiences and will work with persistent and / or very distressing emotional problems. It can help unravel feelings where they have been burdening you for a longer period of time and may be more evidently affecting you in your present day. Often psychotherapy helps with persistent concerns such as anxiety, sadness, fearfulness, anger, low self-worth and self-esteem, PTSD, feelings of loss, guilt, shame or more complex mental health concerns such as. It can explore damaging patterns of behaviour you feel may be impacting you&nbsp;</p></div>
